h1. Overview

Muto is a lightweight little ruby/vbs/bat script that I put together that will allow you switch to another version of Ruby whilst also allowing you to alter
your Windows Environment at the same time. You can do this with Muto without having to reload your command prompt/shell and all of your gem paths etc are
automatically updated as you change versions.

h2. Why I put this together..

Firstly, I'm not trying to take anything from Pik, check it out first if you haven't already, there's a thousand things you can do with it and it might be
better suited to what your needs are: https://github.com/vertiginous/pik

I put Muto together because I needed to also frequently change a few environment variables every time I changed my version of ruby and I just got sick
of having to do it all the time and then having to reload my command prompt as well just to pick up the changes. Also I needed to be able to switch
ruby versions and persist the change to another version of Ruby across my entire Windows environment.

h2. Example Usage
<pre>
muto
  =>Expected format:  muto [ruby_version]
  =>
  =>Available Versions are:
  =>  186   - ruby 1.8.6 (2007-09-24 patchlevel 111) [i386-mswin32]
  =>  192   - ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18) [i386-mingw32]
  =>
  =>Currently using:
  =>  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-09-24 patchlevel 111) [i386-mswin32]

ruby -v
  =>ruby 1.8.6 (2007-09-24 patchlevel 111) [i386-mswin32]

muto 192
  =>System updated. Now using:
  =>ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18) [i386-mingw32]

ruby -v
  =>ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18) [i386-mingw32]
</pre>

h2. How Muto works..

Muto works by using an executable .bat file to call a ruby script which will alter your systems environment variables and send an environment changed
signal to your Windows environment. It'll then finish by calling a basic vb script to update the shell you're working in so that you won't need to
restart your command prompt.

The muto gem is not really a gem.. It's just basically a wrapper to help copy these scripts to your machine somewhere.


h2. Setup/Config

Use a normal Windows MRI version of Ruby to install Muto.
<pre>gem install muto</pre>

From the command line, change into a directory where you want to keep the scripts and run: extract_muto

<pre>cd c:\
extract_muto

  =>Extracting to C:\Muto
  =>Generating C:\Muto\muto.rb
  =>Generating C:\Muto\reset_command_line.vbs
  =>Generating C:\Muto\ruby_versions.yml
  =>Writing C:\Muto\muto.bat file..
  =>
  =>Add Ruby versions to your C:\Muto\ruby_versions.yml"
  =>Then add C:\Muto to your Windows PATH environment variable and you're good to go
</pre>


h3. ruby_versions.yml

As well as being able to switch to other versions of Ruby in your Windows environment, you can also define other User Environment Variables to change at
the same time. Muto switches versions of Ruby by just regex-ing out the ruby bin folder out of your Windows PATH variable and replacing it with the new
version you choose. This way none of the other paths in your environments PATH variable are altered.

The User Environment Variables are set completely differently! The values you give them are the full values used to define the variable so if there is an
existing variable already defined in your User Environment variables then it will be overwritten with the new value.

<pre>
# ruby_versions.yml example

ruby_versions:
  ruby_186:
    shortcut: 186
    bin_folder: C:\ruby\bin
  ruby_192:
    shortcut: 192
    bin_folder: C:\ruby192\bin

  jruby_164_jre6:
    shortcut: jr_j6
    bin_folder: C:\jruby-1.6.4\bin
    exe_name: jruby.exe
    user_env_variables:
      java_home: C:\Program Files\Java\jre6
  jruby_164_jre7:
    shortcut: jr_j7
    bin_folder: C:\jruby-1.6.4\bin
    exe_name: jruby.exe
    user_env_variables:
      java_home: C:\Program Files\Java\jre7
